# Brain-Brawl

## Problem Statement:
In an era where educational institutions seek advanced and seamless methods for academic assessments, a challenge persists in providing user-friendly, real-time evaluation platforms for universities and colleges. The current systems often lack interactive features and fail to deliver an engaging 1v1 contest-based assessment experience. The absence of such an effective evaluation platform hinders the enhancement of learning experiences and the achievement of academic excellence within educational institutions. This prompts the need to address the deficiency by developing an innovative, comprehensive solution that facilitates real-time, user-friendly evaluations while fostering interactive 1v1 contest-based assessments, aligning with the project's vision to empower educational institutions and promote enhanced learningÂ experiences.

## Solution : 
Welcome to the Brain-Brawl Django REST application repository! This backend application is designed to support the Flutter-based "Brain-Brawl" application, where students from different universities can compete in knockout competitions involving assessments that challenge both accuracy and speed.

## Application Overview

The Brain-Brawl application's main functionality is to facilitate knockout competitions among students from different universities. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

- When you start a knockout competition, you are matched with a student from another university who also joined under the same subject.
- You and your opponent get to battle each other by answering assessments within 30-45 seconds, depending on the question's complexity.
- The competition requires both accuracy and speed to win.
- The winners will rise on the leaderboard, and the competition continues until there is only one winner among all the universities participating in the knockout competition.
